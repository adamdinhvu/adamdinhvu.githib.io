I'm confronted by a screen and no obvious buttons to click but when you do click a panel slides out of the way and you get a new, you get a list of titles that when you mass over them, are there going to italics and the background changes.There's also this road and the bottom that has accessibility options that you can click and also a way of changing the scholars, colours game and social media links everything you mass over has some kind of interactivity interactive feature to it Clicking any of the main titles will lead you to

A slide out panel with more information.

And you can click out of it to go to the main screen.

While there's a panel up, the background never fully disappears and there's like a lead shadow effect that makes everything seem like it's on top of each other.

I think it's good enough.
