                <b>My honest, first two minutes of interaction with the website:</b><i>
There's a screen and no obvious buttons to click but when you do click a panel slides out of the way.
Then you get a list of titles that when you mouse over them, they become italicized and the background changes. 
There's also this row at the bottom that has accessibility options and also a way of changing the colour theme.
Everything you mouse over has some kind of interactivity, whether that be a change of colour or a change in the background.
Clicking any of the main titles will lead you to a slide out panel with more information, additionally you can click out of it to go to the main screen.
While there's a panel up, the background never fully disappears and there's a shadow effect that makes everything seem like it's on top of each other.

<pre><b><i>     What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</b></i>
The first thing I noticed was the acknowledgment of country that scrolls through the top of the screen.

<b><i>      What did you spend the most time engaging with?</b></i>
I spent most of my time interacting with the titles on the right of the screen, that would open up into more layered panels.

<b><i>      What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</b></i>
The common action I did was clicking on the exposed space on the left that would take me back to the home screen.

<b><i>      What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</b></i>
The primary goal of this experience is to promote the arts festival.

<b><i>      How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</b></i>
There are a few different methods that the website uses to communicate its goal.
The website uses very bold colours and in-your-face design elements like big titles, scrolling text, and changing backgrounds. This projects a sense of confidence, and helps make an impression of the festival on the user. 
When you first load the website, you are given a short manifesto of the festival that you must click away to disperse that reads, "Live in a world shaped by artists."

<b><i>      What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</b></i>
I don't believe that the intended length of an interaction is very long, given how navigating the website can be somewhat clunky. I think instead, the design of the website is to make a bold first impression with expressive design, rather than a streamlined website that is meant used regularly. I think you are meant to spend less than five minutes on the website, and you are not meant to use it regularly.

                Metaphors

<b><i>      What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</b></i>
The metaphor that the next wave festival engages with most is the metaphor of a panel or a sliding door. Whenever the user clicks on a button a sliding panel will come in from the right of the screen, and it will overlay part of the screen with a drop shadow. 

<b><i>      What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</b></i>
This metaphor wants you to feel like the website is incredibly modern or futuristic. Sliding doors are only a feature of relatively modern buildings and a sliding panel display evokes science fictions displays, like that used by someone like Tony Stark. 

<b><i>      What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</b></i>
Although futuristic, I find the sliding panel displays to be frustrating. When I first opened the website, I was incredibly confused about navigation, as it had not aligned with many of the frames of web interaction I was used to. Additionally, it creates a noticeable lag when using the website. 
The fact that the website has an option to "remove clutter" says something about the functionality of the website. If plain CSS is more usable than the website's design, then the design has clearly placed more emphasis on form over function. Although this is not necessarily a bad thing, I think when a website is displaying information like this, that information should be accessible.  

<b><i>      What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</b></i>
The most satisfying element is the way the background will change instantly when the user mouses over a title. Even though the backgrounds are arbitrary patterns and not related to the titles, I find that instant feedback like this to be incredibly enjoyable.
